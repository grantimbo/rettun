    <h4>Rettun was created by Peter James and Thomas Albert, 2 brothers born in Manchester, they quickly made business relationships with many people within the US and from there the company just kept growing and growing into the Multi-Million dollar corporation it is today. So where did Rettun start and where are you going?</h4>

    <h3>How did the company begin?</h3>
    
    <p>“Me and Thomas are brothers and used to work together within my travel agency business. We would always bounce ideas off each other and one day we decided to design and manufacture our own steering wheel cover, so we did exactly this, it was a steering wheel cover that protected your hands from a cold or hot steering wheel in the extreme summer and winter months.</p>
    <p>After selling for just a couple of months our sales soon escalated into 1000s of cover sales per month, we even became the best seller overtaking other products that already had 1000s of reviews.</p>
    
    <p>We soon noticed that a lot of older people was using our steering wheel cover and claiming it helped them to drive their vehicles even with their chronic arthritis. Although we could not make medical claims on Amazon, we developed that product further based on the customers feedback and soon dominated that whole category based on selling to older drivers.</p>
    
    <p>It was such a great feeling to know we had created a product that was helping 1000s of people. From this hunger of wanting to hold onto this high, Rettun was borne”. Said Company CEO Peter James.</p>
    
    <h3>What is the goal of Rettun?</h3>
    
    <p>“Our company message is simple – We care about our customer, we give them what they want, we provide the best customer experience, it really is that simple.</p>
    
    <p>Although we have made millions of dollars in sales and revenue, almost every cent has gone back into the business, we are not here to be average and just take the customers money, we are here to make Rettun the biggest and the best it can be, we really get a buzz from growing this company and giving more to the customer. The best part is the more we sell the more we can give back to the customer.</p>
    
    <p>Our aim is simple…keep on providing what the customers want, we do really care about our customers and we listen to everything they say, this is why we are always investing company profits into expanding our Research and Development team and making our products into market leaders”. Said Company COO Thomas Albert.</p>
